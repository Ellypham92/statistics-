### :pencil: Problem:
A typical Starbucks location has 1 or 2 baristas making drinks.  The company is considering opening larger cafes with more machines and more baristas.  The file **coffee.txt** contains 53 days of test data collected by Starbucks in a city where some larger stores are already open.  On each day they observed a different store during its busiest 20-minute period and recorded $x=$ the number of baristas working and $Y=$ the number of customers served.   They want a regression model to predict the number of customers as a function of the number of baristas.  In particular they wish to predict the number of customers which can be served by 2 baristas and by 8 baristas.
